<h2> C O L O R S Q U A L O R </h2>
    <i><u>Setup</u></i> 
    <br/>
+ 2 players
    <br/>
+ 10 cards each
    <br/>
+ Game board is placed blue side facing up
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i><u>Gameplay</u></i>     
  <br/>
The deck is shuffled and ten cards are given to each player.
    <br/>
Players pick either a red, blue, or yellow character to represent them.
    <br/>
These are placed on opposite corners of the same side of the board.
    <br/>
Each turn consists of a move (by the person who's turn it is)    
    <br/>
and a counter-move (by the other player). Players alternate
    <br/>
until they run out of cards, and the player with the most
    <br/>
colored squares on the board at the end wins. To begin play,    
    <br/>
player 1 places one of their colored cards on their board side.
    <br/>
The opponent must now counter. Different color/square number
    <br/>
combinations have different meanings...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i><u>Match Ups</u></i>
    <br/>
+ If player 2 counters a color card with a card of
    <br/>
  same color/number, the value of player 1's card is null
    <br/>
  and the card is placed upside down beside the board.  
    <br/>
+ If player 2 counters a double color card with a single
    <br/>
  color card of the same color, player 1's card is flipped
    <br/>
  but remains on the board as a colorless card worth 1 square.
    <br/>
+ In the event that player 2 attempts to counter a color card which 
    <br/>
  matches the color of player 1's red, blue, or yellow character, 
    <br/>
  the value of the card can only be reduced to a colorless 1 square.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i><u>Color Combinations</u></i>
    <br/>
As colored cards line up down the board, certain color combinations
    <br/>
become possible. On their turn, a player may choose to play a card
    <br/>
which is the combination of the last two colors played in the row above.
    <br/>
Red with blue makes purple, red with yellow makes orange, and blue with 
    <br/>
yellow makes green. Any combination color card played directly below its
    <br/>
two parent cards doubles in value. Players keep track of doubled values. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i><u>Special Cards</u></i>
    <br/>
+ Peppermint - removes all cards of one color from opponent's board
    <br/>
+ Ice cream - unflips one colorless card from your side
    <br/>
+ Peanut - grants one card immunity from reduction or elimination 
    <br/>
+ Candy cane - skips opponents counter move.
